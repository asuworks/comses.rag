Here is the improved and professionally formatted Markdown text for the scientific paper. The following adjustments have been made:

- Proper use of headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) for sections and subsections.
- Correct formatting for inline math ($$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$) and block math ($$E = mc^2$$).
- Consistent use of bullet points, numbered lists, and tables.
- Proper citation formatting using footnotes.
- Indentation for code blocks and pre-formatted text.
- Consistency in text styling (bold, italics) for emphasis.

# Foragers to Farmers (F2F) Agent-Based Model

**Michael Storozum, Elske van der Vaart, Tim Dorscheidt, Nicolas Gauthier**  
*The original model was developed by Elske van der Vaart, Bart de Boer, Albert Hankel, Bart Verheij (2006) in the Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB '06), later extended by Tim Dorscheidt (2012).*

This document describes the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) for a replication of the model named ABscape. The model description follows the ODD protocol for describing individual and agent-based models.

## 1. Purpose

This model represents an effort to replicate one of the first attempts to develop an agent-based model of agricultural origins using principles and equations drawn from human behavioral ecology.

## 2. Entities, State Variables, and Scales

### 2.1 Globals, Agents, and Patches

**Globals:** There are over forty global variables in this model that serve various purposes (see Appendix). These variables are derived from human behavioral ecology literature to provide empirical estimates of time, energy, and growth experienced by agents per tick.

**Agents:** Four agent types are modeled:
- Bands of hunter-gatherers
- Prey animals
- Wild cereals
- Farms  

Each band starts with 20 individuals and reproduces with a probability of 0.02 per individual per time step. Once a band reaches 40 individuals, it splits into two bands.

**Patches:** The scape consists of a $$21 \times 21$$ grid of patches (300 km² each). The world is divided into three habitats: *lush*, *medium*, and *desert*, with varying carrying capacities for resources.

### 2.2 Agent Behavioral Rules

The rules guiding agent behavior are based on the Ideal Free Distribution model:
1. **Dietary Preferences:** Agents prioritize prey over cereal; farming is a last resort.
2. **Energy Values:** Prey and cereal provide calories ($$e_i$$) but require handling time ($$h_i$$) and incur costs ($$c_s$$, $$c_h$$).
3. **Population Growth:** Prey and cereal grow according to:

$$
p_{i}(t+1) = p_{i}(t) \cdot \frac{C_{i} \cdot e^{r_{i}}}{C_{i} \cdot (1 - s_{i} \cdot t \cdot (1 - e^{r_{i}}))}
$$

4. **Search Times:** Search times depend on population density ($$d_i$$):

$$
s_{i} = \frac{1}{s_s \cdot s_r \cdot 2 \cdot d_i}
$$

5. **Net Acquisition Rates (NAR):** Energy efficiency is calculated as:

$$
NAR_i = \frac{e_i}{s_i + h_i} - \frac{s_i}{s_i + h_i} \cdot c_s - \frac{h_i}{s_i + h_i} \cdot c_h
$$

## 3. Process Overview and Scheduling

The model operates in two phases:
1. **Setup Phase:** Variables are initialized.
2. **Go Phase:** Includes functions for procreation, movement, resource acquisition, and resource growth.

---

## 4. Model Design Concepts

The model is based on the Ideal Free Distribution theory, which predicts settlement patterns based on habitat quality relative to population density.

---

## 5. Initialization

Variables are initialized during the setup phase (see Tables in Appendix). Key parameters include:
- **Birth Chance:** Default = 10%
- **Band Size at Start:** Default = 20 individuals
- **Resource Degradation Factor:** Determines how quickly resources deplete.

---

## 6. Inputs

Rainfall data can be input via a text file to simulate environmental variability.

### 6.1 Parameter Values

Refer to Tables in Appendix for detailed parameter values.

---

## 7. Model Implementation

The model was originally implemented in Java but has been reimplemented in NetLogo version 6.40.
